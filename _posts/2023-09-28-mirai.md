## Nmap

## _**Initial Foothold**_

### Enumerate HTTP (port 80)
Dirbusting using Dirsearch.

Visiting the /admin page we find pi-hole:

Since there arent any obvious attack vectors I decided to look deeper into the name “Mirai” to find what it meant.

Maybe default credentials are left open on SSH, since we know the raspberry pi is probably running raspbian we can use those default credentials to attempt to log in: `pi:raspberry`.

Since hydra confirms the default credentials we can now SSH into the box.

## _**Priv Esc**_
Since we are a part of the sudoers group we already have root permissions, however root.txt doesnt contain a flag.

Checking what devices are mounted we find a USB mounted to /media/usbstick.

Enumerating that folders reveals a damnit.txt file.
![Pasted image 20240715103918.png](/images/Pasted image 20240715103918.png){: .normal }

Running the strings command on the device “/dev/sdb” reveals the flag.


## User.txt

## Root.txt

## You have PWNED
